He kneads you until you are pliant;  And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.  *****  All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.  But if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace love’s pleasure,  Then it is better for you that you cover  nakedness pass out of love’s threshing-floor,  Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, weep, but not all of your tears.  *****  Love gives naught but itself takes naught but from itself.  Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;  For love is sufficient unto love.  When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”  And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.  Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.  But if you love must needs have desires, let these be your desires:  To melt be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.  the pain of too much tenderness.  To be wounded by your own of love;  And to bleed willingly joyfully.  To wake at dawn with a winged heart give thanks for another day of loving;  To rest at the noon hour meditate love’s ecstacy;  To return home at eventide with gratitude;  And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart a song of praise upon your lips.  [Illustration: 0029]  ***** *****   Almitra spoke again said, And what of _Marriage_ master?  And he answered saying:  You were born together, together you shall be forevermore.  You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.  Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.  But let there be spaces in your togetherness,  And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.  *****  Love one another, but make not a bond of love:  Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.  Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.  Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.  dance together be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,  Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.  *****  Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.  For only the of Life can contain your hearts.  And together yet not too near together:  For the pillars of the temple apart,  And the oak tree the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.  [Illustration: 0032]  ***** *****   a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of _Children_.  And he said:  Your children are not your children.  They are the sons daughters of Life’s longing for itself.  They come through you but not from you,  And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.  *****  You may give them your love but not your thoughts,  For they have their own thoughts.  You may house their bodies but not their souls,  For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.  You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.  goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.  You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.  The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift far.  Let your bending in the Archer’s be for gladness;  For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.  ***** *****   said a rich man, Speak to us of _Giving_.  And he answered:  You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.  For what are your possessions but things you keep guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?  And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?  And what is fear of need but need itself?  Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?  There are those who give little of the  which they they give it for recognition their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.  And there are those who have little give it all.  These are the believers in life the bounty of life, their coffer is never empty.  There are those who give with joy, that joy is their reward.  And there are those who give with pain, that pain is their baptism.  And there are those who give know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;  They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.  Through the of such as these God speaks, from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.  [Illustration: 0039]  It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through  And to the the search for  who shall receive is joy greater than giving.  And is there aught you would withhold?  All you have shall some day be given;  Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours not your inheritors’.  You often say, “I would give, but only to the deserving.”  The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.  They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.  Surely he who is worthy to receive his days his nights, is worthy of all else from you.  And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.  And what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in the courage the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?  And who are you that men should rend  bosom unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked their pride unabashed?  See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, an instrument of giving.  For in truth it is life that gives unto life--while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.  And you you are all receivers--assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself upon him who gives.  Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;  For to be overmindful of your debt, is ito doubt his generosity who has the freehearted earth for mother, God for father.  [Illustration: 0042]  ***** *****   an old man, a keeper of an inn, said, Speak to us of _Eating Drinking_.  And he said:  Would that you could live on the fragrance of the earth, like an air plant be sustained by the light.  But since you must kill to eat, rob the newly born of its mother’s milk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship,  And let your board an altar on which the pure the innocent of forest plain are sacrificed for that which is purer still more innocent in man.  *****  When you kill a beast say to him in your heart,  “By the same power that slays you, I too am slain; I too shall be consumed.  the law that delivered you into my shall deliver me into a mightier  Your blood my blood is naught but the sap that feeds the tree of heaven.”  *****  And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart,  “Your seeds shall live in my body,  And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,  And your fragrance shall be my breath, And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons.”  *****  And in the autumn, when you gather the grapes of your vineyards for the winepress, say in your heart,  “I too am a vineyard, my fruit shall be gathered for the winepress,  And like new wine I shall be kept in eternal vessels.”  And in winter, when you draw the wine,  there be in your heart a song for each cup;  And let there be in the song a remembrance for the autumn days, for the vineyard, for the winepress.  ***** *****   Then a ploughman said, Speak to us of _Work_.  And he answered, saying:  You work that you may keep pace with the earth the soul of the earth.  For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, to step out of life’s procession, that marches in majesty proud submission towards the infinite.  When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.  Which of you would be a reed, dumb silent, when all else sings together in unison?  Always you have been told that work is a curse labour a misfortune.  But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth’s furthest dream,  to you when that dream was born,  And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,  And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret.  *****  But if you in your pain call birth an affliction the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.  You have been told also that life is darkness, in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.  And I say that life is indeed darkness ‘save when there is urge,  And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,  And all knowledge is vain save when there is work,  And all work is empty save when there is love;  And when you work with love you bind  to yourself, to one another, to God.  *****  And what is it to work with love?  It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.  It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.  It is to sow seeds with tenderness reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.  It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,  And to know that all the blessed dead are about you watching.  Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, “He who works in marble, finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is nobler than he who ploughs the soil.  he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the for our feet.”  But I say, not in sleep but in the overwakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass;  And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving.  *****  Work is love made visible.  And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work sit at the gate of the temple take alms of those who work with joy.  For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man’s hunger.  And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison in the wine.  if you sing though as angels, love not the singing, you muffle man’s ears to the voices of the day the voices of the night.  ***** *****   a woman said, Speak to us of _Joy Sorrow_.  And he answered:  Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.  And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.  And how else can it be?  The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?  And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?  When you are joyous, look deep into your heart you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.  When you are sorrowful look again in  heart, you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.  *****  Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.”  But I say unto you, they are inseparable.  Together they come, when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.  Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow your joy.  Only when you are empty are you at balanced.  When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.  ***** *****   a mason came forth said, Speak to us of _Houses_.  And he answered said:  Build of your imaginings a bower in the wilderness ere you build a house within the city walls.  For even as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the in you, the ever distant alone.  Your house is your larger body.  It grows in the sun sleeps in the stillness of the night; it is not dreamless. Does not your house dream? dreaming, leave the city for grove or hilltop?  Would that I could gather your houses into my like a sower scatter them in forest meadow.  Would the valleys were your streets, the green paths your alleys, that you  seek one another through vineyards, come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments.  But these things are not yet to be.  In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that fear shall endure a little longer. A little longer shall your city walls separate your hearths from your fields.  *****  And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses? And what is it you guard with fastened doors?  Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power?  Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that span the summits of the mind?  Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood stone to the holy mountain?  Tell me, have you these in your houses?  Or have you only comfort, the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that  the house a guest, then becomes a host, then a master?  *****  Ay, it becomes a tamer, with hook scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.  Though its are silken, its heart is of iron.  It lulls you to sleep only to by your bed jeer at the dignity of the flesh.  It makes mock of your sound senses, lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels.  Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, then walks grinning in the funeral.  But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tamed.  Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast.  It shall not be a glistening film that  a wound, but an eyelid that guards the eye.  You shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceiling, nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack fall down.  You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living.  And though of magnificence splendour, your house shall not hold your secret nor shelter your longing.  For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose door is the morning mist, whose windows are the songs the silences of night.  ***** *****   the weaver said, Speak to us of _Clothes_.  And he answered:  Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun the wind with more of your skin less of your raiment,  For the breath of life is in the sunlight the of life is in the wind.  Some of you say, “It is the north wind who has woven the clothes we wear.”  And I say, Ay, it was the north wind,  But shame was his loom, the softening of the sinews was his thread.  And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.  not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.  And when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter a fouling of the mind?  And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet the winds long to play with your hair.  ***** *****   a merchant said, Speak to us of _Buying Selling_.  And he answered said:  To you the earth yields her fruit, you shall not want if you but know how to fill your  It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance be satisfied.  Yet unless the exchange be in love kindly justice, it will but lead some to greed others to hunger.  When in the market place you toilers of the sea fields vineyards meet the weavers the potters the gatherers of spices,--  Invoke then the master spirit of the earth, to come into your midst sanctify the scales the reckoning that weighs value against value.  not the to take part in your transactions, who would sell their words for your labour.  To such men you should say,  “Come with us to the field, or go with our brothers to the sea cast your net;  For the the sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us.”  *****  And if there come the singers the dancers the flute players,--buy of their gifts also.  For they too are gatherers of fruit frankincense, that which they bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment food for your soul.  And before you leave the market place, see that no one has gone his way with empty  For the master spirit of the earth shall not sleep peacefully upon the wind till the needs of the least of you are satisfied.  ***** *****   one of the judges of the city stood forth said, Speak to us of _Crime Punishment_.  And he answered, saying:  It is when your spirit goes upon the wind,  That you, alone unguarded, commit a wrong unto others therefore unto yourself.  And for that wrong committed must you knock wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed.  Like the ocean is your god-self;  It remains for ever undefiled.  And like the ether it lifts but the winged.  Even like the sun is your god-self;  It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.  your god-self dwells not alone in your being.  Much in you is still man, much in you is not yet man,  But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening.  And of the man in you would I now speak.  For it is he not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist, that knows crime the punishment of crime.  *****  Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you an intruder upon your world.  But I say that even as the holy the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you,  So the wicked the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also.  And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree,  the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.  Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self.  [Illustration: 0064]  You are the way the wayfarers.  And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone.  Ay, he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.  And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:  The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,  And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed.  The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,  And the is not clean in the doings of the felon.  Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,  And still more often the condemned is  burden bearer for the guiltless unblamed.  You cannot separate the just from the unjust the good from the wicked;  For they together before the face of the sun even as the black thread the white are woven together.  And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, he shall examine the loom also.  *****  If any of you would bring to judgment the unfaithful wife,  Let him also weigh the heart of her in scales, measure his soul with measurements.  And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offended.  And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness lay the ax unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots;  And verily he will find the roots of the good the bad, the fruitful the  all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth.  And you judges who would be just,  What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh yet is a thief in spirit?  What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit?  And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver an oppressor,  Yet who also is aggrieved outraged?  *****  And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds?  Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve?  Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guilty.  Unbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake gaze upon themselves.  you who would justice, how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of light?  Only then shall you know that the erect the fallen are but one man in twilight between the night of his pigmy-self the day of his god-self, And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation.  ***** *****   a lawyer said, But what of our _Laws_, master?  And he answered:  You delight in laying down laws,  Yet you delight more in breaking them.  Like children playing by the ocean who build with constancy then destroy them with laughter.  But while you build your the ocean brings more to the shore,  And when you destroy them the ocean laughs with you.  Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.  But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, man-made laws are not  But to whom life is a rock, the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness?  of the cripple who hates dancers?  What of the ox who loves his yoke deems the elk deer of the forest stray vagrant things?  What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, calls all others naked shameless?  And of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, when over-fed tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation all feasters lawbreakers?  *****  What shall I say of these save that they too in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?  They see only their shadows, their shadows are their laws.  And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?  And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down trace their shadows upon the earth?  But you who walk facing the sun, what  drawn on the earth can hold you?  You who travel with the wind, what weather-vane shall direct your course?  What man’s law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man’s prison door?  What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man’s iron chains?  And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man’s path?  *****  People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall the skylark not to sing?  ***** *****   an orator said, Speak to us of _Freedom_.  And he answered:  At the city gate by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself worship your own freedom,  Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant praise him though he slays them.  Ay, in the grove of the temple in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke a  And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal a fulfilment.  You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your  without a want a grief,  But rather when these things girdle your life yet you rise above them naked unbound.  *****  And how shall you rise beyond your days nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your have fastened around your noon hour?  In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun dazzle your eyes.  And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?  If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own upon your own forehead.  You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.  And if it is a despot you would  see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.  For how can a tyrant rule the free the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom a shame in their own pride?  And if it is a care you would cast off, that cart has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.  And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart not in the of the feared.  *****  Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired the dreaded, the repugnant the cherished, the pursued that which you would escape.  These things move within you as lights shadows in pairs that cling.  And when the shadow fades is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.  And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.  ***** *****   the priestess spoke again said: Speak to us of _Reason Passion_.  And he answered, saying:  Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield, upon which your reason your judgment wage war against your passion your appetite.  Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn the discord the rivalry of your elements into oneness melody.  But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the lovers of all your elements?  Your reason your passion are the rudder the sails of your seafaring soul.  If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss drift, or else be held at a in mid-seas.  reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction.  Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion, that it may sing;  And let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection, like the phoenix rise above its own ashes.  *****  I would have you consider your judgment your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house.  Surely you would not honour one guest above the other; for he who is more mindful of one loses the love the faith of both  Among the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars, sharing the peace serenity of distant fields meadows--then let your heart say in silence, “God rests in reason.”  And when the storm comes, the  wind shakes the forest, thunder lightning proclaim the majesty of the sky,--then let your heart say in awe, “God moves in passion.”  And since you are a breath in God’s sphere, a leaf in God’s forest, you too should rest in reason move in passion.  ***** *****   a woman spoke, saying, Tell us of _Pain_.  And he said:  Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your  Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may in the sun, so must you know pain.  And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;  And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.  And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.  Much of your pain is self-chosen.  It is the bitter potion by which the physician  you heals your sick self.  Therefore trust the physician, drink his remedy in silence tranquillity: For his though heavy hard, is guided by the tender of the Unseen, And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.  ***** *****   a man said, Speak to us of _Self-Knowledge_.  And he answered, saying:  Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days the nights.  But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge.  You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.  You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.  And it is well you should.  The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise run murmuring to the sea;  And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.  But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;  And seek not the depths of your  with staff or sounding line.  For self is a sea boundless measureless.  *****  Say not, “I have found the truth,” but rather, “I have found a truth.”  Say not, “I have found the path of the soul.” Say rather, “I have met the soul walking upon my path.”  For the soul walks upon all paths.  The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.  The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.  [Illustration: 0083]  ***** *****   said a teacher, Speak to us of _Teaching_.  And he said:  “No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.  The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith his lovingness.  If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind.  The astronomer may speak to you of his of space, but he cannot give you his  The musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot give you the ear which arrests the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it.  he who is versed in the science of numbers can tell of the regions of weight measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.  For the vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.  And even as each one of you alone in God’s knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God in his of the earth.  ***** *****   a youth said, Speak to us of _Friendship_.  And he answered, saying:  Your friend is your needs answered.  He is your field which you sow with love reap with thanksgiving.  And he is your board your fireside.  For you come to him with your hunger, you seek him for peace.  When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the “nay” in your own mind, nor do you withhold the “ay.”  And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;  For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.  When you part from your friend, you grieve not;  For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.  let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.  For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: only the unprofitable is caught.  *****  And let your best be for your friend.  If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.  For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to live.  For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.  And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, sharing of pleasures.  For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning is refreshed.  ***** *****   then a scholar said, Speak of _Talking_.  And he answered, saying:  You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;  And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, sound is a diversion a pastime.  And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.  For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.  There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.  The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves they would escape.  And there are those who talk,  knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not  And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.  In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.  *****  When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place, let the spirit in you move your lips direct your tongue.  Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;  For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is remembered  When the colour is forgotten the vessel is no more.  ***** *****   an astronomer said, Master, what of _Time_?  And he answered:  You would measure time the measureless the immeasurable.  You would adjust your conduct even direct the course of your spirit according to hours seasons.  Of time you would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit watch its flowing.  Yet the timeless in you is aware of life’s timelessness,  And knows that yesterday is but today’s memory tomorrow is today’s dream.  And that that which sings contemplates in you is still dwelling within the bounds of that first moment which scattered the stars into space.  among you does not feel that his power to love is boundless?  And yet who does not feel that very love, though boundless, encompassed within the centre of his being, moving not from love thought to love thought, nor from love deeds to other love deeds?  And is not time even as love is, undivided paceless?  *****  But if in your thought you must measure time into seasons, let each season encircle all the other seasons,  And let today embrace the past with remembrance the future with longing.  ***** *****   one of the elders of the city said, Speak to us of _Good Evil_.  And he answered:  Of the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil.  For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger thirst?  Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.  You are good when you are one with yourself.  Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.  For a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house.  And a ship without rudder may aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom.  are good when you strive to give of yourself.  Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.  For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth sucks at her breast.  Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, “Be like me, ripe full ever giving of your abundance.”  For to the fruit giving is a need, as receiving is a need to the root.  *****  You are good when you are fully awake in your speech,  Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose.  And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.  You are good when you walk to your goal firmly with bold steps.  Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping.  those who limp go not backward.  But you who are strong swift, see that you do not limp before the lame, deeming it kindness.  *****  You are good in countless ways, you are not evil when you are not good,  You are only loitering sluggard.  Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles.  In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: that longing is in all of you.  But in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the sea, carrying the secrets of the hillsides the songs of the forest.  And in others it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles bends lingers before it reaches the shore.  But let not him who longs much say to  who longs little, “Wherefore are you slow halting?”  For the truly good ask not the naked, “Where is your garment?” nor the houseless, “What has befallen your house?”  ***** *****   a priestess said, Speak to us of _Prayer_.  And he answered, saying:  You pray in your distress in your need; would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy in your days of abundance.  For what is prayer but the expansion of yourself into the living ether?  And if it is for your comfort to pour your darkness into space, it is also for your delight to pour forth the dawning of your heart.  And if you cannot but weep when your soul summons you to prayer, she should spur you again yet again, though weeping, until you shall come laughing.  When you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very  whom save in prayer you may not meet.  Therefore let your visit to that temple invisible be for naught but ecstasy sweet communion.  For if you should enter the temple for no other purpose than asking you shall not receive:  And if you should enter into it to humble yourself you shall not be lifted:  Or even if you should enter into it to beg for the good of others you shall not be heard.  It is enough that you enter the temple invisible.  *****  I cannot teach you how to pray in words.  God listens not to your words save when He Himself utters them through your lips.  And I cannot teach you the prayer of the seas the forests the mountains.  you who are born of the mountains the forests the seas can find their prayer in your heart,  And if you but listen in the stillness of the night you shall hear them saying in silence,  “Our God, who art our winged self, it is thy will in us that willeth.  It is thy desire in us that desireth.  It is thy urge in us that would turn our nights, which are thine, into days which are thine also.  We cannot ask thee for aught, for thou knowest our needs before they are born in us:  Thou art our need; in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all.”  [Illustration: 0100]  ***** *****   a hermit, who visited the city once a year, came forth said, Speak to us of _Pleasure_.  And he answered, saying:  Pleasure is a freedom-song,  But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires,  But it is not their fruit.  It is a depth calling unto a height,  But it is not the deep nor the high.  It is the caged taking wing,  But it is not space encompassed.  Ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-song.  And I fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart; yet I would not have you lose your hearts in the singing.  Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, they are judged rebuked.  would not judge nor rebuke them. I would have them seek.  For they shall find pleasure, but not her alone;  Seven are her sisters, the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure.  Have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots found a treasure?  *****  And some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs committed in drunkenness.  But regret is the beclouding of the mind not its chastisement.  They should remember their pleasures with gratitude, as they would the harvest of a summer.  Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them be comforted.  And there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to remember;  And in their fear of seeking remembering  shun all pleasures, lest they neglect the spirit or offend against it.  But even in their foregoing is their pleasure.  And thus they too find a treasure though they dig for roots with quivering  But tell me, who is he that can offend the spirit?  Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of the night, or the firefly the stars?  And shall your flame or your smoke burden the wind?  Think you the spirit is a still pool which you can trouble with a staff?  *****  Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store the desire in the recesses of your being.  Who knows but that which seems omitted today, waits for tomorrow?  Even your body knows its heritage its rightful need will not be deceived.  And your body is the harp of your soul,  And it is yours to bring forth  from it or confused sounds.  *****  And now you ask in your heart, “How shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good?”  Go to your fields your gardens, you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower,  But it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee.  For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life,  And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love,  And to both, bee flower, the giving the receiving of pleasure is a need an ecstasy.  People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers the bees.  ***** *****   a poet said, Speak to us of _Beauty_.  And he answered:  Where shall you seek beauty, how shall you find her unless she herself be your way your guide?  And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech?  The aggrieved the injured say, “Beauty is kind gentle.  Like a young mother half-shy of her own glory she walks among us.”  And the passionate say, “Nay, beauty is a thing of might dread.  Like the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us the sky above us.”  The tired the weary say, “Beauty is of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit.  voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow.”  But the restless say, “We have heard her shouting among the mountains,  And with her cries came the sound of hoofs, the beating of wings the roaring of lions.”  At night the watchmen of the city say, “Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east.”  And at noontide the toilers the wayfarers say, “We have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset.”  *****  In winter say the snow-bound, “She shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills.”  And in the summer heat the reapers say, “We have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves, we saw a drift of snow in her hair.”  these things have you said of beauty,  Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied,  And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.  It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty stretched forth,  But rather a heart enflamed a soul enchanted.  It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear,  But rather an image you see though you close your eyes a song you hear though you shut your ears.  It is not the sap within the furrowed bark, nor a wing attached to a claw,  But rather a garden for ever in bloom a flock of angels for ever in flight.  *****  People of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.  But you are life you are the veil.  is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.  But you are eternity you are the mirror.  ***** *****   an old priest said, Speak to us of _Religion_.  And he said:  Have I spoken this day of aught else?  Is not religion all deeds all reflection,  And that which is neither deed nor reflection, but a wonder a surprise ever springing in the soul, even while the hew the stone or tend the loom?  Who can separate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupations?  Who can spread his hours before him, saving, “This for God this for myself; This for my soul, this other for my body?”  All your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self.  wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.  The wind the sun will tear no holes in his skin.  And he who defines his conduct by ethics imprisons his song-bird in a cage.  The freest song comes not through bars wires.  And he to whom worshipping is a window, to open but also to shut, has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn.  *****  Your daily life is your temple your religion.  Whenever you enter into it take with you your all.  Take the plough the forge the mallet the lute,  The things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight.  For in revery you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures.  And take with you all men:  in adoration you cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair.  *****  And if you would know God be not therefore a solver of riddles.  Rather look about you you shall see Him playing with your children.  And look into space; you shall see Him walking in the cloud, outstretching His arms in the lightning descending in rain.  You shall see Him smiling in flowers, then rising waving His in trees.  ***** *****   Almitra spoke, saying, We would ask now of _Death_.  And he said:  You would know the secret of death.  But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?  The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.  If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.  For life death are one, even as the river the sea are one.  In the depth of your hopes desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;  And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.  Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.  fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he before the king whose is to be laid upon him in honour.  Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?  Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?  *****  For what is it to die but to naked in the wind to melt into the sun?  And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise seek God unencumbered?  Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.  And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.  And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.  now it was evening.  And Almitra the seeress said, Blessed be this day this place your spirit that has spoken.  And he answered, Was it I who spoke? Was I not also a listener?  *****  Then he descended the steps of the Temple all the people followed him. And he reached his ship stood upon the deck.  And facing the people again, he raised his voice said:  People of Orphalese, the wind bids me leave you.  Less hasty am I than the wind, yet I must go.  We ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; no sunrise finds us where sunset left us.  while the earth sleeps we travel.  We are the seeds of the tenacious plant, it is in our ripeness our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind are scattered.  *****  Brief were my days among you, briefer still the words I have spoken.  But should my voice fade in your ears, my love vanish in your memory, then I will come again,  And with a richer heart lips more yielding to the spirit will I speak.  Yea, I shall return with the tide,  And though death may hide me, the greater silence enfold me, yet again will I seek your  And not in vain will I seek.  If aught I have said is truth, that truth shall reveal itself in a clearer voice, in words more kin to your thoughts.  I go with the wind, people of Orphalese, but not down into emptiness;  if this day is not a fulfilment of your needs my love, then let it be a promise till another day.  Man’s needs change, but not his love, nor his desire that his love should satisfy his needs.  Know therefore, that from the greater silence I shall return.  The mist that drifts away at dawn, leaving but dew in the fields, shall rise gather into a cloud then fall down in rain.  And not unlike the mist have I been.  In the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets, my spirit has entered your houses,  And your heart-beats were in my heart, your breath was upon my face, I knew you all.  Ay, I knew your joy your pain, in your sleep your dreams were my dreams.  And oftentimes I was among you a lake among the mountains.  I mirrored the summits in you the  slopes, even the passing flocks of your thoughts your desires.  And to my silence came the laughter of your children in streams, the longing of your youths in rivers.  And when they reached my depth the streams the rivers ceased not yet to sing.  [Illustration: 0119]  But sweeter still than laughter greater than longing came to me.  It was the boundless in you;  The vast man in whom you are all but cells sinews;  He in whose chant all your singing is but a soundless throbbing.  It is in the vast man that you are vast,  And in beholding him that I beheld you loved you.  For what distances can love reach that are not in that vast sphere?  What visions, what expectations what presumptions can outsoar that flight?  Like a giant oak tree covered with apple blossoms is the vast man in you.  binds you to the earth, his fragrance lifts you into space, in his durability you are deathless.  *****  You have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link.  This is but half the truth. You are also as strong as your strongest link.  To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam.  To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy.  Ay, you are like an ocean,  And though heavy-grounded ships await the tide upon your shores, yet, even like an ocean, you cannot hasten your tides.  And like the seasons you are also,  And though in your winter you deny your spring,  Yet spring, reposing within you, smiles in her drowsiness is not offended.  not I say these things in order that you may say the one to the other, “He praised us well. He saw but the good in us.”  I only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought.  And what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge?  Your thoughts my words are waves from a sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays,  And of the ancient days when the earth knew not us nor herself,  And of nights when earth was up-wrought with confusion.  *****  Wise men have come to you to give you of their wisdom. I came to take of your wisdom:  And behold I have found that which is greater than wisdom.  It is a flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself,  While you, heedless of its expansion, bewail the withering of your days.  is life in quest of life in bodies that fear the grave.  *****  There are no graves here.  These mountains plains are a cradle a stepping-stone.  Whenever you pass by the field where you have laid your ancestors look well thereupon, you shall see yourselves your children dancing in  Verily you often make merry without knowing.  Others have come to you to whom for golden promises made unto your faith you have given but riches power glory.  Less than a promise have I given, yet more generous have you been to me.  You have given me my deeper thirsting after life.  Surely there is no greater gift to a man than that which turns all his aims into parching lips all life into a fountain.  [Illustration: 0125]   in this lies my honour my reward,--  That whenever I come to the fountain to drink I find the living water itself thirsty;  And it drinks me while I drink it.  *****  Some of you have deemed me proud over-shy to receive gifts.  Too proud indeed am I to receive wages, but not gifts.  And though I have eaten berries among the hills when you would have had me sit at your board,  And slept in the portico of the temple when you would gladly have sheltered me,  Yet was it not your loving mindfulness of my days my nights that made food sweet to my mouth girdled my sleep with visions?  For this I bless you most:  You give much know not that you give at all.  the kindness that gazes upon itself in a mirror turns to stone,  And a good deed that calls itself by tender names becomes the parent to a curse.  *****  And some of you have called me aloof, drunk with my own aloneness,  And you have said, “He holds council with the trees of the forest, but not with men.  He sits alone on hill-tops looks down upon our city.”  True it is that I have climbed the hills walked in remote places.  How could I have seen you save from a great height or a great distance?  How can one be indeed near unless he be tar?  And others among you called unto me, not in words, they said,  “Stranger, stranger, lover of unreachable heights, why dwell you among the summits where eagles build their nests?  seek you the unattainable?  What storms would you trap in your net,  And what vaporous birds do you hunt in the sky?  Come be one of us.  Descend appease your hunger with our bread quench your thirst with our wine.”  In the solitude of their souls they said these things;  But were their solitude deeper they would have known that I sought but the secret of your joy your pain,  And I hunted only your larger selves that walk the sky.  *****  But the hunter was also the hunted;  For many of my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast.  And the flier was also the creeper;  For when my wings were spread in the sun their shadow upon the earth was a turtle.  And I the believer was also the doubter;  often have I put my finger in my own wound that I might have the greater belief in you the greater knowledge of you.  *****  And it is with this belief this knowledge that I say,  You are not enclosed within your bodies, nor confined to houses or fields.  That which is you dwells above the mountain roves with the wind.  It is not a thing that crawls into the sun for warmth or digs holes into darkness for safety,  But a thing free, a spirit that envelops the earth moves in the ether.  If these be vague words, then seek not to clear them.  Vague nebulous is the beginning of all things, but not their end,  And I fain would have you remember me as a beginning.  Life, all that lives, is conceived in the mist not in the crystal.  who knows but a crystal is mist in decay?  *****  This would I have you remember in remembering me:  That which seems most feeble bewildered in you is the strongest most determined.  Is it not your breath that has erected hardened the structure of your bones?  And is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt, that builded your city fashioned all there is in it?  Could you but see the tides of that breath you would cease to see all else,  And if you could hear the whispering of the dream you would hear no other sound.  But you do not see, nor do you hear, it is well.  The veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the that wove it,  And the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that kneaded it.  you shall see.  And you shall hear.  Yet you shall not deplore having known blindness, nor regret having been deaf.  For in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things,  And you shall bless darkness as you would bless light.  After saying these things he looked about him, he saw the pilot of his ship by the helm gazing now at the full sails now at the distance.  And he said:  Patient, over patient, is the captain of my ship.  The wind blows, restless are the sails;  Even the rudder begs direction;  Yet quietly my captain awaits my silence.  And these my mariners, who have heard the choir of the greater sea, they too have heard me patiently.  they shall wait no longer.  I am ready.  The stream has reached the sea, once more the great mother holds her son against her breast.  *****  Fare you well, people of Orphalese.  This day has ended.  It is closing upon us even as the water-lily upon its own tomorrow.  What was given us here we shall keep,  And if it suffices not, then again must we come together together stretch our unto the giver.  Forget not that I shall come back to you.  A little while, my longing shall gather dust foam for another body.  A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, another woman shall bear me.  Farewell to you the youth I have spent with you.  It was but yesterday we met in a dream.  have sung to me in my aloneness, I of your longings have built a tower in the sky.  But now our sleep has fled our dream is over, it is no longer dawn.  The noontide is upon us our half waking has turned to fuller day, we must part.
