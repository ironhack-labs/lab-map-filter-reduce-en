       "'PROPHET  |Almustafa, chosen beloved, who was dawn unto own day, had waited twelve years city of Orphalese ship that was to return bear him back isle of his birth.  And twelfth year, on seventh day Ielool, month reaping, he climbed hill without city walls looked seaward; beheld his ship coming mist.  Then gates heart flung open, joy flew far over sea. And closed eyes prayed silences soul.  *****  But as descended hill, sadness came upon him, thought his heart:  How shall I go peace without sorrow? Nay, without wound spirit shall I leave city.  days pain I have spent within its walls, long nights aloneness; who can depart from pain aloneness without regret?  Too many fragments spirit have I scattered these streets, too many are children my longing that walk naked among these hills, I cannot withdraw them without burden ache.  It garment I cast off this day, skin that I tear my own hands.  Nor thought I leave behind me, but heart made sweet hunger with thirst.  *****  Yet I cannot tarry longer.  The sea that calls things unto her calls me, I must embark.  For stay, though hours burn in night, freeze crystallize be bound mould.  Fain would I take me that is here. But how shall I?  A voice cannot carry tongue  lips that gave wings. Alone must seek ether.  And alone without nest shall eagle fly across sun.  *****  Now when reached foot hill, turned again towards sea, saw ship approaching harbour, upon her prow mariners, men own land.  And soul cried out them, he said:  Sons my ancient mother, riders of tides,  How often have sailed my dreams. And now come my awakening, which is my deeper dream.  Ready am I go, my eagerness with sails full awaits wind.  Only another breath will I breathe in this still air, only another loving look cast backward,  And then I shall stand among you, seafarer among seafarers.  you, vast sea, sleepless mother,  Who alone peace freedom river stream,  Only another winding will stream make, only another murmur glade,  And then shall I come you, boundless drop boundless ocean.  *****  And as walked saw afar men women leaving their fields their vineyards hastening towards city gates.  And heard their voices calling his name, shouting field field telling one another coming his ship.  And said himself:  Shall day parting be day of gathering?  And shall be said that my eve was in truth my dawn?  And what shall I unto him who has left plough midfurrow, to him who has stopped wheel his winepress?  my heart become tree heavy-laden fruit that I may gather unto them?  And shall my desires flow like fountain that I fill their cups?  Am I harp that hand mighty may touch me, flute that breath may pass through me?  A seeker silences am I, what treasure have I found silences that I may dispense confidence?  If my day harvest, what fields have I sowed seed, in what unremembered seasons?  If indeed be hour which I lift up my lantern, my flame that shall burn therein.  Empty dark shall I raise my lantern,  And guardian night shall fill it oil shall light also.  *****  These things said words. But much in heart remained unsaid.  speak deeper secret.  *****  [Illustration: 0020]  And when entered into city all people meet him, they were crying out him as one voice.  And elders city stood forth said:  Go yet us.  A noontide have been our twilight, your youth has given us dreams dream.  No stranger among us, nor guest, our son our dearly beloved.  Suffer yet our eyes hunger for your face.  *****  And priests priestesses said unto him:  Let waves sea separate us now, years have spent our midst become memory.  You have walked among us spirit,  your shadow has been light upon our faces.  Much have we loved you. But speechless was our love, veils has been veiled.  Yet now cries aloud unto you, would stand revealed you.  And ever has been that love knows not its own depth until hour of separation.  *****  And others also entreated him. But answered them not. He only bent his head; who stood near saw his tears falling upon breast.  And people proceeded towards square temple.  And there out sanctuary woman whose name was Almitra. And she was seeress.  And looked upon her exceeding tenderness, was she who had first sought believed him when had been day their city.  hailed him, saying:  Prophet God, quest uttermost, long have searched distances your ship.  And now your ship has come, must needs go.  Deep your longing land of your memories dwelling place of your greater desires; our love would bind nor our needs hold you.  Yet we ask ere leave us, that you speak us us your truth.  And we will unto our children, they unto their children, it shall perish.  In your aloneness have watched with our days, your wakefulness you have listened weeping laughter our sleep.  Now therefore disclose us ourselves, tell us that has been shown you that which between birth death.  *****  And answered,  People Orphalese, what can I  save that which even now moving within your souls?  ***** *****  Then said Almitra, Speak us of _Love_.  And raised head looked upon people, there fell stillness upon them. And voice he said:  When love beckons you, follow him,  Though ways hard steep.  And when wings enfold yield to him,  Though sword hidden among his pinions wound you.  And when speaks believe in him,  Though voice shatter your dreams as north wind lays waste garden.  For even as love crowns shall he crucify you. Even as your growth your pruning.  Even as ascends your height  your tenderest branches that quiver sun,  So shall descend your roots shake them their clinging earth.  *****  Like sheaves corn gathers unto himself.  He threshes make naked.  He sifts free your husks.  He grinds whiteness.  He kneads until pliant;  And then assigns sacred fire, that become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.  *****  All these things shall love do unto you that know secrets your heart, that knowledge become fragment Life’s heart.  But if your fear would seek only love’s peace love’s pleasure,  Then better that you cover  nakedness pass out of love’s threshing-floor,  Into seasonless you shall laugh, your laughter, weep, your tears.  *****  Love gives naught itself takes naught itself.  Love possesses nor would be possessed;  For love sufficient unto love.  When love should say, “God is my heart,” rather, “I am in heart God.”  And think can direct course of love, love, if finds you worthy, directs your course.  Love has desire fulfil itself.  But if love must needs have desires, let these be your desires:  To melt be like running brook that sings its melody night.  pain too much tenderness.  To be wounded your own understanding of love;  And bleed willingly joyfully.  To wake dawn winged heart give thanks another day loving;  To rest noon hour meditate love’s ecstacy;  To return home eventide with gratitude;  And then sleep prayer for beloved your heart song of praise upon your lips.  [Illustration: 0029]  ***** *****   Almitra spoke again said, And what _Marriage_ master?  And answered saying:  You born together, together you shall be forevermore.  You shall be together when white wings death scatter your days.  Aye, shall be together even silent memory God.  But let there be spaces your togetherness,  And let winds heavens dance between you.  *****  Love one another, make bond of love:  Let rather be moving sea between shores your souls.  Fill each other’s cup drink from one cup.  Give one another your bread eat not same loaf.  dance together be joyous, let each one be alone,  Even as strings lute alone though they quiver same music.  *****  Give your hearts, into each other’s keeping.  For only hand Life can contain your hearts.  And stand together yet too near together:  For pillars temple stand apart,  And oak tree cypress grow not each other’s shadow.  [Illustration: 0032]  ***** *****   woman who held babe against her bosom said, Speak us of _Children_.  And said:  Your children your children.  They sons daughters of Life’s longing itself.  They come through you,  And though they yet they belong you.  *****  You them your love your thoughts,  For they have their own thoughts.  You house their bodies their souls,  For their souls dwell house of tomorrow, which cannot visit, not even your dreams.  You strive be like them, seek not make them like you.  goes backward nor tarries with yesterday.  You bows which your children as living arrows sent forth.  The archer sees mark upon path of infinite, He bends with His might that His arrows go swift far.  Let your bending Archer’s hand be for gladness;  For even as loves arrow that flies, He loves also bow that is stable.  ***** *****   said rich man, Speak us of _Giving_.  And answered:  You little when of your possessions.  It when yourself that you truly give.  For what your possessions things you keep guard fear need them tomorrow?  And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to overprudent dog burying bones in trackless sand as follows pilgrims holy city?  And what fear need need itself?  Is dread thirst when your well is full, thirst that unquenchable?  There who little  which they have--and they give it recognition their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.  And there who have little give all.  These believers bounty life, their coffer is never empty.  There who joy, that joy their reward.  And there who pain, that pain their baptism.  And there who know not pain giving, nor do they seek joy, nor mindfulness of virtue;  They as yonder valley myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.  Through hands such as these God speaks, behind their eyes He smiles upon earth.  [Illustration: 0039]  It well when asked, it is better unasked, through understanding;  And open-handed search for  who shall receive joy greater than giving.  And there aught would withhold?  All have shall day be given;  Therefore now, that season of giving be yours your inheritors’.  You often say, “I would give, only to deserving.”  The trees your orchard say so, nor flocks your pasture.  They that they live, to withhold perish.  Surely who worthy receive his days nights, worthy all else you.  And who has deserved drink from ocean deserves fill his cup your little stream.  And what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies courage confidence, nay charity, of receiving?  And who that men should rend  bosom unveil their pride, that see their worth naked their pride unabashed?  See first that yourself deserve to be giver, instrument giving.  For truth that gives unto life--while you, who deem yourself giver, witness.  And receivers--and are all receivers--assume weight of gratitude, lest lay yoke upon yourself upon him who gives.  Rather rise together giver on his gifts as on wings;  For be overmindful your debt, is ito doubt generosity who has freehearted earth mother, God for father.  [Illustration: 0042]  ***** *****   old man, keeper inn, said, Speak us _Eating Drinking_.  And said:  Would that live on fragrance earth, like air plant be sustained light.  But since must kill eat, rob newly born its mother’s milk to quench your thirst, let then be act worship,  And let your board stand altar on which pure innocent of forest plain sacrificed that which purer still more innocent in man.  *****  When kill beast say him your heart,  “By same that slays you, I too am slain; I too shall be consumed.  law that delivered into my hand shall deliver me into mightier hand.  Your blood my blood naught but sap that feeds tree heaven.”  *****  And when crush apple your teeth, say your heart,  “Your seeds shall live my body,  And buds your tomorrow shall blossom my heart,  And your fragrance shall be my breath, And together we shall rejoice through all seasons.”  *****  And autumn, when gather grapes your vineyards winepress, say your heart,  “I too am vineyard, my fruit shall be gathered winepress,  And like new wine I shall be kept in eternal vessels.”  And winter, when draw wine,  there be your heart song for each cup;  And let there be song remembrance autumn days, for vineyard, winepress.  ***** *****   Then ploughman said, Speak to us _Work_.  And answered, saying:  You work that keep pace earth soul earth.  For be idle become stranger unto seasons, step out of life’s procession, that marches in majesty proud submission towards infinite.  When work flute through whose heart whispering hours turns music.  Which would be reed, dumb silent, when sings together in unison?  Always have been told that work curse labour misfortune.  But I say that when work you fulfil part earth’s furthest dream,  when that dream was born,  And keeping yourself labour you are truth loving life,  And love through labour be intimate life’s inmost secret.  *****  But if your pain call birth affliction support flesh curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught sweat of your brow shall wash that which is written.  You have been told also that is darkness, your weariness echo what was said weary.  And I say that indeed darkness ‘save when there urge,  And urge blind save when there is knowledge,  And knowledge vain save when there work,  And work empty save when there is love;  And when work love bind  yourself, one another, God.  *****  And what work love?  It weave cloth threads drawn your heart, even as if your beloved wear that cloth.  It build house affection, even as if your beloved dwell in that house.  It sow seeds tenderness reap harvest joy, even as if your beloved eat fruit.  It charge things fashion with breath your own spirit,  And know that blessed dead are standing about watching.  Often have I heard say, as if speaking sleep, “He who works in marble, finds shape own soul stone, nobler than who ploughs soil.  who seizes rainbow lay on cloth likeness man, more than who makes sandals our feet.”  But I say, sleep overwakefulness noontide, that wind speaks more sweetly giant oaks than least blades grass;  And alone who turns voice wind into song made sweeter own loving.  *****  Work love made visible.  And if cannot work love but only distaste, better that you should leave your work sit at gate temple take alms of those who work joy.  For if bake bread indifference, you bake bitter bread that feeds but half man’s hunger.  And if grudge crushing grapes, your grudge distils poison in wine.  if sing though as angels, love singing, you muffle man’s ears voices day voices night.  ***** *****   woman said, Speak us of _Joy Sorrow_.  And answered:  Your joy your sorrow unmasked.  And selfsame well which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.  And how can be?  The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, more joy can contain.  Is cup that holds your wine very cup that was burned potter’s oven?  And lute that soothes your spirit, very wood that was hollowed with knives?  When joyous, look deep into your heart shall find only that which has given sorrow that is giving joy.  When sorrowful look again in  heart, shall see that in truth weeping that which has been your delight.  *****  Some say, “Joy greater than sorrow,” others say, “Nay, sorrow is greater.”  But I say unto you, they are inseparable.  Together they come, when one sits alone your board, remember that asleep upon your bed.  Verily suspended like scales between your sorrow your joy.  Only when empty at standstill balanced.  When treasure-keeper lifts to weigh gold silver, needs must your joy your sorrow rise or fall.  ***** *****   mason forth said, Speak us _Houses_.  And answered said:  Build your imaginings bower wilderness ere build house within city walls.  For even as have home-comings in your twilight, has wanderer in you, ever distant alone.  Your house your larger body.  It grows sun sleeps stillness night; not dreamless. Does your house dream? dreaming, leave city grove or hilltop?  Would that I gather your houses into my hand, like sower scatter them forest meadow.  Would valleys your streets, green paths your alleys, that you  seek one another through vineyards, come fragrance of earth your garments.  But these things yet be.  In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that fear shall endure little longer. A little longer shall your city walls separate your hearths your fields.  *****  And tell me, people Orphalese, what have these houses? And what it you guard fastened doors?  Have peace, quiet urge that reveals your power?  Have remembrances, glimmering arches that span summits mind?  Have beauty, that leads heart from things fashioned wood stone to holy mountain?  Tell me, have these your houses?  Or have only comfort, lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that  house guest, then becomes host, then master?  *****  Ay, becomes tamer, with hook scourge makes puppets your larger desires.  Though its hands silken, its heart is iron.  It lulls sleep only stand by your bed jeer dignity flesh.  It makes mock your sound senses, lays them thistledown like fragile vessels.  Verily lust comfort murders passion soul, then walks grinning funeral.  But you, children space, restless in rest, shall be trapped nor tamed.  Your house shall be anchor mast.  It shall be glistening film that  wound, eyelid that guards eye.  You shall fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike against ceiling, nor fear breathe lest walls should crack fall down.  You shall dwell tombs made dead living.  And though magnificence splendour, your house shall hold your secret nor shelter your longing.  For that which boundless you abides mansion sky, whose door morning mist, whose windows songs silences of night.  ***** *****   weaver said, Speak us of _Clothes_.  And answered:  Your clothes conceal much your beauty, yet they hide unbeautiful.  And though seek garments freedom privacy find them harness chain.  Would that meet sun wind more your skin less of your raiment,  For breath sunlight hand wind.  Some say, “It north wind who has woven clothes we wear.”  And I say, Ay, was north wind,  But shame was loom, softening sinews was thread.  And when work was done laughed in forest.  that modesty is shield against eye unclean.  And when unclean shall be more, what modesty fetter fouling mind?  And forget that earth delights to feel your bare feet winds long play your hair.  ***** *****   merchant said, Speak us of _Buying Selling_.  And answered said:  To earth yields her fruit, you shall want if know how to fill your hands.  It exchanging gifts earth that shall find abundance be satisfied.  Yet unless exchange be love kindly justice, will lead to greed others hunger.  When market place toilers of sea fields vineyards meet weavers potters gatherers spices,--  Invoke then master spirit earth, come into your midst sanctify scales reckoning that weighs value against value.  barren-handed take part your transactions, who would sell their words your labour.  To such men should say,  “Come us field, go with our brothers sea cast your net;  For land sea shall be bountiful even as us.”  *****  And if there come singers dancers flute players,--buy of their gifts also.  For they too gatherers fruit frankincense, that which they bring, though fashioned dreams, raiment food your soul.  And leave market place, see that one has gone way with empty hands.  For master spirit earth shall not sleep peacefully upon wind till needs least are satisfied.  ***** *****   one judges city stood forth said, Speak us of _Crime Punishment_.  And answered, saying:  It when your spirit goes wandering upon wind,  That you, alone unguarded, commit wrong unto others therefore unto yourself.  And that wrong committed must you knock wait while unheeded gate blessed.  Like ocean your god-self;  It remains ever undefiled.  And like ether lifts winged.  Even like sun your god-self;  It knows ways mole nor seeks holes serpent.  your god-self dwells alone in your being.  Much still man, much in you yet man,  But shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in mist searching its own awakening.  And man would I now speak.  For your god-self nor pigmy mist, that knows crime punishment crime.  *****  Oftentimes have I heard speak one who commits wrong as though were not one you, stranger unto you intruder upon your world.  But I say that even as holy righteous cannot rise beyond highest which each one you,  So wicked weak cannot fall lower than lowest which you also.  And as single leaf turns yellow but silent knowledge whole tree,  wrong-doer cannot do wrong without hidden will you all.  Like procession walk together towards your god-self.  [Illustration: 0064]  You way wayfarers.  And when one falls down falls for behind him, caution against stumbling stone.  Ay, falls ahead him, who though faster surer foot, yet removed stumbling stone.  And also, though word lie heavy upon your hearts:  The murdered unaccountable for his own murder,  And robbed blameless being robbed.  The righteous innocent deeds wicked,  And white-handed clean doings felon.  Yea, guilty oftentimes victim of injured,  And still more often condemned is  burden bearer guiltless unblamed.  You cannot separate just unjust good wicked;  For they stand together face of sun even as black thread white woven together.  And when black thread breaks, weaver shall look into whole cloth, shall examine loom also.  *****  If any would bring judgment unfaithful wife,  Let him also weigh heart her husband scales, measure soul with measurements.  And let him who would lash offender look unto spirit offended.  And if any would punish name righteousness lay ax unto evil tree, let him see its roots;  And verily will find roots good bad, fruitful  entwined together in silent heart earth.  And judges who would be just,  What judgment pronounce upon him who though honest flesh yet thief spirit?  What penalty lay upon him who slays in flesh yet himself slain spirit?  And how prosecute him who action is deceiver oppressor,  Yet who also aggrieved outraged?  *****  And how shall punish whose remorse already greater than their misdeeds?  Is remorse justice which is administered that very law which you would fain serve?  Yet cannot lay remorse upon innocent nor lift heart of guilty.  Unbidden shall call night, that men wake gaze upon themselves.  who would understand justice, how shall unless you look upon deeds fullness of light?  Only then shall know that erect fallen one man standing in twilight between night his pigmy-self day god-self, And that corner-stone temple is higher than lowest stone in its foundation.  ***** *****   lawyer said, But what our _Laws_, master?  And answered:  You delight laying down laws,  Yet delight more breaking them.  Like children playing ocean who build sand-towers constancy then destroy them laughter.  But while build your sand-towers ocean brings more sand shore,  And when destroy them ocean laughs you.  Verily ocean laughs always innocent.  But what whom not ocean, man-made not sand-towers,  But whom rock, law chisel which they would carve it in their own likeness?  cripple who hates dancers?  What ox who loves yoke deems elk deer forest stray vagrant things?  What old serpent who cannot shed his skin, calls others naked shameless?  And him who comes early wedding-feast, when over-fed tired goes way saying that all feasts violation feasters lawbreakers?  *****  What shall I say these save that they too stand sunlight, with their backs sun?  They see only their shadows, their shadows their laws.  And what sun them caster of shadows?  And what acknowledge laws stoop down trace their shadows upon earth?  But who walk facing sun, what  drawn on earth can hold you?  You who travel wind, what weather-vane shall direct your course?  What man’s law shall bind if you break your yoke upon man’s prison door?  What shall fear if dance but stumble against man’s iron chains?  And who that shall bring to judgment if tear off your garment yet leave man’s path?  *****  People Orphalese, can muffle drum, can loosen strings of lyre, who shall command skylark sing?  ***** *****   orator said, Speak us of _Freedom_.  And answered:  At city gate your fireside I have seen prostrate yourself worship your own freedom,  Even as slaves humble themselves before tyrant praise him though slays them.  Ay, grove temple in shadow citadel I have seen freest among wear their freedom as yoke handcuff.  And my heart bled within me; you can only be free when even desire of seeking freedom becomes harness to you, when cease speak of freedom as goal fulfilment.  You shall be free indeed when your days without care nor your  without want grief,  But rather when these things girdle your life yet rise above them naked unbound.  *****  And how shall rise beyond your days nights unless break chains which dawn your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?  In truth that which call freedom is strongest these chains, though its links glitter sun dazzle your eyes.  And what fragments your own self would discard that may become free?  If unjust law would abolish, that law was written your own hand upon your own forehead.  You cannot erase burning your law books nor washing foreheads of your judges, though pour sea upon them.  And if despot would  see first that throne erected within destroyed.  For how can tyrant rule free proud, tyranny their own freedom shame their own pride?  And if care would cast off, that cart has been chosen rather than imposed upon you.  And if fear would dispel, seat that fear your heart hand feared.  *****  Verily things move within your being in constant half embrace, desired dreaded, repugnant cherished, pursued that which you would escape.  These things move within as lights shadows pairs that cling.  And when shadow fades no more, light that lingers becomes shadow another light.  And thus your freedom when loses its fetters becomes itself fetter greater freedom.  ***** *****   priestess spoke again said: Speak us _Reason Passion_.  And answered, saying:  Your soul oftentimes battlefield, upon which your reason your judgment wage war against your passion your appetite.  Would that I be peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn discord rivalry your elements into oneness melody.  But how shall I, unless yourselves be also peacemakers, nay, lovers of your elements?  Your reason your passion rudder sails your seafaring soul.  If either your sails your rudder be broken, can toss drift, or be held standstill in mid-seas.  reason, ruling alone, is force confining; passion, unattended, flame that burns its own destruction.  Therefore let your soul exalt your reason height passion, that it may sing;  And let direct your passion with reason, that your passion live through its own daily resurrection, like phoenix rise above its own ashes.  *****  I would have consider your judgment your appetite even as would two loved guests your house.  Surely would honour one guest above other; who more mindful one loses love faith both  Among hills, when sit cool shade white poplars, sharing peace serenity distant fields meadows--then let your heart say in silence, “God rests reason.”  And when storm comes,  wind shakes forest, thunder lightning proclaim sky,--then let your heart say awe, “God moves passion.”  And since breath God’s sphere, leaf God’s forest, you too should rest reason move in passion.  ***** *****   woman spoke, saying, Tell us of _Pain_.  And said:  Your pain breaking shell that encloses your understanding.  Even as stone fruit must break, that its heart stand sun, must know pain.  And keep your heart wonder at daily miracles your life, your pain would seem less wondrous than your joy;  And would accept seasons your heart, even as have always accepted seasons that pass over your fields.  And would watch serenity through winters your grief.  Much your pain self-chosen.  It bitter potion which physician  heals your sick self.  Therefore trust physician, drink his remedy silence tranquillity: For hand, though heavy hard, is guided tender hand Unseen, And cup brings, though burn your lips, has been fashioned clay which Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.  ***** *****   man said, Speak us of _Self-Knowledge_.  And answered, saying:  Your hearts know silence secrets of days nights.  But your ears thirst sound of your heart’s knowledge.  You would know words that which you have always known thought.  You would touch your fingers naked body your dreams.  And well should.  The hidden well-spring your soul must needs rise run murmuring sea;  And treasure your infinite depths would be revealed your eyes.  But let there be scales weigh your unknown treasure;  And seek depths your  staff sounding line.  For self sea boundless measureless.  *****  Say not, “I have found truth,” but rather, “I have found truth.”  Say not, “I have found path soul.” Say rather, “I have met soul walking upon my path.”  For soul walks upon paths.  The soul walks upon line, neither does grow like reed.  The soul unfolds itself, like lotus of countless petals.  [Illustration: 0083]  ***** *****   said teacher, Speak us of _Teaching_.  And said:  “No man can reveal aught that which already lies half asleep dawning your knowledge.  The teacher who walks shadow of temple, among followers, gives not wisdom rather his faith lovingness.  If indeed wise does bid you enter house wisdom, but rather leads threshold of your own mind.  The astronomer speak his understanding space, cannot give understanding.  The musician sing rhythm which space, he cannot ear which arrests rhythm nor voice that echoes it.  who versed science of can tell regions of weight measure, cannot conduct thither.  For vision one man lends its wings another man.  And even as each one stands alone in God’s knowledge, must each one of you be alone knowledge God in understanding earth.  ***** *****   youth said, Speak us of _Friendship_.  And answered, saying:  Your friend your needs answered.  He your field which sow love reap thanksgiving.  And your board your fireside.  For come him your hunger, seek him peace.  When your friend speaks mind you fear “nay” your own mind, nor do withhold “ay.”  And when silent your heart ceases not listen heart;  For without words, friendship, all thoughts, desires, expectations are born shared, joy that is unacclaimed.  When part your friend, you grieve not;  For that which love most him may be clearer absence, as mountain climber clearer from plain.  let there be no purpose friendship save deepening of spirit.  For love that seeks aught disclosure its own mystery not love net cast forth: only unprofitable caught.  *****  And let your best be your friend.  If must know ebb your tide, let him know its flood also.  For what your friend that should seek him hours kill?  Seek him always hours live.  For fill your need, not your emptiness.  And sweetness friendship let there be laughter, sharing of pleasures.  For dew little things heart finds its morning is refreshed.  ***** *****   then scholar said, Speak of _Talking_.  And answered, saying:  You talk when cease be peace with your thoughts;  And when can longer dwell solitude your heart live your lips, sound diversion pastime.  And much your talking, thinking is half murdered.  For thought bird space, that in cage words indeed unfold its wings cannot fly.  There among who seek talkative through fear being alone.  The silence aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves they would escape.  And there who talk,  knowledge forethought reveal truth which they themselves do not understand.  And there who have truth within them, they tell in words.  In bosom such as these spirit dwells rhythmic silence.  *****  When meet your friend on roadside market place, let spirit move your lips direct your tongue.  Let voice within your voice speak to ear ear;  For soul will keep truth of your heart as taste wine is remembered  When colour forgotten vessel more.  ***** *****   astronomer said, Master, what of _Time_?  And answered:  You would measure time measureless immeasurable.  You would adjust your conduct even direct course your spirit according hours seasons.  Of time would make stream upon whose bank would sit watch its flowing.  Yet timeless aware of life’s timelessness,  And knows that yesterday today’s memory tomorrow today’s dream.  And that that which sings contemplates still dwelling within bounds that first moment which scattered stars into space.  among does feel that his power love boundless?  And yet who does feel that very love, though boundless, encompassed within centre being, moving love thought love thought, nor love deeds other love deeds?  And time even as love is, undivided paceless?  *****  But if your thought must measure time into seasons, let each season encircle seasons,  And let today embrace past with remembrance future longing.  ***** *****   one elders city said, Speak us _Good Evil_.  And answered:  Of good I can speak, not of evil.  For what evil good tortured by its own hunger thirst?  Verily when good hungry seeks food even dark caves, when thirsts it drinks even dead waters.  You good when one with yourself.  Yet when one yourself you evil.  For divided house den of thieves; only divided house.  And ship without rudder wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not bottom.  good when you strive yourself.  Yet evil when seek gain for yourself.  For when strive gain are but root that clings earth sucks her breast.  Surely fruit cannot say root, “Be like me, ripe full ever giving your abundance.”  For fruit giving need, as receiving need root.  *****  You good when fully awake in your speech,  Yet evil when sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose.  And even stumbling speech strengthen weak tongue.  You good when walk your goal firmly bold steps.  Yet evil when go thither limping.  who limp go not backward.  But who strong swift, see that do limp lame, deeming kindness.  *****  You good countless ways, you are evil when good,  You only loitering sluggard.  Pity that stags cannot teach swiftness turtles.  In your longing your giant self lies your goodness: that longing in all you.  But that longing torrent rushing might sea, carrying secrets hillsides songs forest.  And others flat stream that loses itself angles bends lingers reaches shore.  But let him who longs much say to  who longs little, “Wherefore are you slow halting?”  For truly good ask naked, “Where your garment?” nor houseless, “What has befallen your house?”  ***** *****   priestess said, Speak us of _Prayer_.  And answered, saying:  You pray your distress your need; would that might pray also in fullness your joy your days abundance.  For what prayer expansion of yourself into living ether?  And if your comfort pour your darkness into space, also for your delight pour forth dawning of your heart.  And if cannot weep when your soul summons prayer, she should spur again yet again, though weeping, until shall come laughing.  When pray rise meet air who praying that very  whom save prayer you may meet.  Therefore let your visit that temple invisible be naught ecstasy sweet communion.  For if should enter temple for no purpose than asking shall not receive:  And if should enter into to humble yourself shall be lifted:  Or even if should enter into to beg good others shall not be heard.  It enough that enter temple invisible.  *****  I cannot teach how pray words.  God listens your words save when He Himself utters them through your lips.  And I cannot teach prayer seas forests mountains.  who born mountains forests seas can find their prayer your heart,  And if listen stillness of night shall hear them saying in silence,  “Our God, who art our winged self, is thy will us that willeth.  It thy desire us that desireth.  It thy urge us that would turn our nights, which thine, into days which are thine also.  We cannot ask thee aught, thou knowest our needs they born in us:  Thou art our need; giving us more of thyself thou givest us all.”  [Illustration: 0100]  ***** *****   hermit, who visited city once year, forth said, Speak to us _Pleasure_.  And answered, saying:  Pleasure freedom-song,  But freedom.  It blossoming your desires,  But their fruit.  It depth calling unto height,  But deep nor high.  It caged taking wing,  But space encompassed.  Ay, very truth, pleasure freedom-song.  And I fain would have sing with fullness heart; yet I would have you lose your hearts singing.  Some your youth seek pleasure as if it all, they judged rebuked.  would judge nor rebuke them. I would have them seek.  For they shall find pleasure, not her alone;  Seven her sisters, least of them more beautiful than pleasure.  Have heard man who was digging earth roots found treasure?  *****  And your elders remember pleasures regret like wrongs committed drunkenness.  But regret beclouding mind its chastisement.  They should remember their pleasures with gratitude, as they would harvest summer.  Yet if comforts them regret, let them be comforted.  And there among who are neither young seek nor old to remember;  And their fear seeking remembering  shun pleasures, lest they neglect spirit offend against it.  But even their foregoing their pleasure.  And thus they too find treasure though they dig roots quivering hands.  But tell me, who that can offend spirit?  Shall nightingale offend stillness night, firefly stars?  And shall your flame your smoke burden wind?  Think spirit still pool which can trouble staff?  *****  Oftentimes denying yourself pleasure you do store desire recesses your being.  Who knows that which seems omitted today, waits tomorrow?  Even your body knows its heritage its rightful need will be deceived.  And your body harp your soul,  And yours bring forth  confused sounds.  *****  And now ask your heart, “How shall we distinguish that which is good pleasure that which not good?”  Go your fields your gardens, you shall learn that pleasure of bee gather honey flower,  But also pleasure flower yield its honey bee.  For bee flower fountain of life,  And flower bee messenger of love,  And both, bee flower, giving receiving pleasure need ecstasy.  People Orphalese, be your pleasures like flowers bees.  ***** *****   poet said, Speak us of _Beauty_.  And answered:  Where shall seek beauty, how shall find her unless she herself be your way your guide?  And how shall speak her except she be weaver your speech?  The aggrieved injured say, “Beauty kind gentle.  Like young mother half-shy her own glory she walks among us.”  And passionate say, “Nay, is thing might dread.  Like tempest she shakes earth beneath us sky above us.”  The tired weary say, “Beauty is of soft whisperings. She speaks our spirit.  voice yields our silences like faint light that quivers in fear shadow.”  But restless say, “We have heard her shouting among mountains,  And her cries sound of hoofs, beating wings roaring lions.”  At night watchmen city say, “Beauty shall rise dawn from east.”  And noontide toilers wayfarers say, “We have seen her leaning over earth windows sunset.”  *****  In winter say snow-bound, “She shall come spring leaping upon hills.”  And summer heat reapers say, “We have seen her dancing autumn leaves, we saw drift of snow her hair.”  these things have said beauty,  Yet truth spoke her of needs unsatisfied,  And need ecstasy.  It mouth thirsting nor empty hand stretched forth,  But rather heart enflamed soul enchanted.  It image would see nor song would hear,  But rather image see though you close your eyes song hear though shut your ears.  It sap within furrowed bark, nor wing attached claw,  But rather garden ever bloom flock angels ever in flight.  *****  People Orphalese, when life unveils her holy face.  But veil.  eternity gazing itself in mirror.  But eternity mirror.  ***** *****   old priest said, Speak us of _Religion_.  And said:  Have I spoken day aught else?  Is religion deeds all reflection,  And that which neither deed nor reflection, wonder surprise ever springing soul, even while hands hew stone tend loom?  Who can separate faith from his actions, belief his occupations?  Who can spread hours him, saving, “This God for myself; my soul, other for my body?”  All your hours wings that beat through space self self.  wears morality as best garment better naked.  The wind sun will tear holes in skin.  And who defines conduct ethics imprisons song-bird cage.  The freest song comes through bars wires.  And whom worshipping window, to also shut, has yet visited house soul whose windows dawn dawn.  *****  Your daily your temple your religion.  Whenever enter into take you your all.  Take plough forge mallet lute,  The things have fashioned in necessity delight.  For revery cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures.  And take men:  in adoration cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair.  *****  And if would know God be not therefore solver riddles.  Rather look about shall see Him playing your children.  And look into space; shall see Him walking cloud, outstretching His arms lightning descending in rain.  You shall see Him smiling flowers, then rising waving His hands in trees.  ***** *****   Almitra spoke, saying, We would ask now _Death_.  And said:  You would know secret death.  But how shall find unless you seek heart life?  The owl whose night-bound eyes blind unto day cannot unveil mystery of light.  If would indeed behold spirit of death, your heart wide unto body life.  For death one, even as river sea one.  In depth your hopes desires lies your silent knowledge beyond;  And like seeds dreaming beneath snow your heart dreams spring.  Trust dreams, them hidden gate eternity.  fear of death trembling shepherd when stands king whose hand be laid upon him in honour.  Is shepherd joyful beneath his trembling, that shall wear mark of king?  Yet more mindful his trembling?  *****  For what die stand naked in wind melt into sun?  And what cease breathing, but to free breath its restless tides, that rise expand seek God unencumbered?  Only when drink river of silence shall indeed sing.  And when have reached mountain top, then shall begin climb.  And when earth shall claim your limbs, then shall truly dance.  now was evening.  And Almitra seeress said, Blessed be this day place your spirit that has spoken.  And answered, Was I who spoke? Was I also listener?  *****  Then descended steps Temple people followed him. And reached ship stood upon deck.  And facing people again, raised his voice said:  People Orphalese, wind bids me leave you.  Less hasty am I than wind, yet I must go.  We wanderers, ever seeking lonelier way, begin day we have ended another day; sunrise finds us where sunset left us.  while earth sleeps we travel.  We seeds tenacious plant, our ripeness our fullness heart that we given to wind scattered.  *****  Brief my days among you, briefer still words I have spoken.  But should my voice fade your ears, my love vanish your memory, then I will come again,  And richer heart lips more yielding spirit will I speak.  Yea, I shall return tide,  And though death hide me, greater silence enfold me, yet again will I seek your understanding.  And vain will I seek.  If aught I have said truth, that truth shall reveal itself clearer voice, words more kin your thoughts.  I go wind, people of Orphalese, down into emptiness;  if day fulfilment of your needs my love, then let it be promise till another day.  Man’s needs change, love, nor desire that love should satisfy needs.  Know therefore, that greater silence I shall return.  The mist that drifts dawn, leaving dew fields, shall rise gather into cloud then fall down rain.  And unlike mist have I been.  In stillness night I have walked your streets, my spirit has entered your houses,  And your heart-beats my heart, your breath was upon my face, I knew all.  Ay, I knew your joy your pain, your sleep your dreams my dreams.  And oftentimes I was among lake among mountains.  I mirrored summits  slopes, even passing flocks your thoughts your desires.  And my silence laughter of your children streams, longing your youths rivers.  And when they reached my depth streams rivers ceased yet to sing.  [Illustration: 0119]  But sweeter still than laughter greater than longing me.  It was boundless you;  The vast man whom but cells sinews;  He whose chant your singing is but soundless throbbing.  It vast man that vast,  And beholding him that I beheld you loved you.  For what distances can love reach that are that vast sphere?  What visions, what expectations what presumptions can outsoar that flight?  Like giant oak tree covered apple blossoms vast man you.  binds earth, his fragrance lifts into space, in his durability deathless.  *****  You have been told that, even like chain, as weak as your weakest link.  This half truth. also as strong as your strongest link.  To measure your smallest deed is reckon ocean frailty its foam.  To judge your failures to cast blame upon seasons their inconstancy.  Ay, like ocean,  And though heavy-grounded ships await tide upon your shores, yet, even like ocean, cannot hasten your tides.  And like seasons also,  And though your winter deny your spring,  Yet spring, reposing within you, smiles in her drowsiness offended.  I say these things in order that say one other, “He praised us well. He saw but good us.”  I only speak words that which yourselves know thought.  And what word knowledge shadow of wordless knowledge?  Your thoughts my words waves from sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays,  And ancient days when earth knew us nor herself,  And nights when earth was up-wrought with confusion.  *****  Wise men have come you of their wisdom. I take your wisdom:  And behold I have found that which is greater than wisdom.  It flame spirit ever gathering more itself,  While you, heedless its expansion, bewail withering your days.  quest in bodies that fear grave.  *****  There graves here.  These mountains plains cradle stepping-stone.  Whenever pass field where you have laid your ancestors look well thereupon, shall see yourselves your children dancing hand hand.  Verily often make merry without knowing.  Others have come whom for golden promises made unto your faith you have given riches glory.  Less than promise have I given, yet more generous have been me.  You have given me my deeper thirsting after life.  Surely there greater gift man than that which turns aims into parching lips into fountain.  [Illustration: 0125]   lies my honour my reward,--  That whenever I come fountain to drink I find living water itself thirsty;  And drinks me while I drink it.  *****  Some have deemed me proud over-shy receive gifts.  Too proud indeed am I receive wages, but gifts.  And though I have eaten berries among hills when would have had me sit at your board,  And slept portico temple when would gladly have sheltered me,  Yet was your loving mindfulness of my days my nights that made food sweet my mouth girdled my sleep with visions?  For I bless most:  You much know that give at all.  kindness that gazes upon itself mirror turns to stone,  And good deed that calls itself by tender names becomes parent curse.  *****  And have called me aloof, drunk my own aloneness,  And have said, “He holds council with trees forest, not with men.  He sits alone on hill-tops looks down upon our city.”  True that I have climbed hills walked remote places.  How I have seen save great height distance?  How can one be indeed near unless be tar?  And others among called unto me, not in words, they said,  “Stranger, stranger, lover of unreachable heights, why dwell among summits eagles build their nests?  seek unattainable?  What storms would trap your net,  And what vaporous birds do hunt in sky?  Come be one us.  Descend appease your hunger our bread quench your thirst our wine.”  In solitude their souls they said these things;  But their solitude deeper they would have known that I sought secret your joy your pain,  And I hunted only your larger selves that walk sky.  *****  But hunter was also hunted;  For many my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast.  And flier was also creeper;  For when my wings spread sun their shadow upon earth was turtle.  And I believer was also doubter;  often have I put my finger in my own wound that I might have greater belief greater knowledge you.  *****  And belief this knowledge that I say,  You enclosed within your bodies, nor confined houses fields.  That which dwells above mountain roves wind.  It thing that crawls into sun warmth digs holes into darkness safety,  But thing free, spirit that envelops earth moves ether.  If these be vague words, then seek not to clear them.  Vague nebulous beginning of all things, their end,  And I fain would have remember me as beginning.  Life, that lives, conceived in mist crystal.  who knows crystal mist in decay?  *****  This would I have remember in remembering me:  That which seems most feeble bewildered strongest determined.  Is your breath that has erected hardened structure your bones?  And dream which none you remember having dreamt, that builded your city fashioned there in it?  Could see tides that breath would cease see else,  And if hear whispering of dream would hear sound.  But do see, nor do hear, it well.  The veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted hands that wove it,  And clay that fills your ears shall be pierced fingers that kneaded it.  shall see.  And shall hear.  Yet shall deplore having known blindness, nor regret having been deaf.  For that day shall know hidden purposes things,  And shall bless darkness as you would bless light.  After saying these things looked about him, saw pilot his ship standing helm gazing now full sails now distance.  And said:  Patient, over patient, captain of my ship.  The wind blows, restless sails;  Even rudder begs direction;  Yet quietly my captain awaits my silence.  And these my mariners, who have heard choir greater sea, they too have heard me patiently.  they shall wait longer.  I am ready.  The stream has reached sea, once more mother holds her son against her breast.  *****  Fare well, people Orphalese.  This day has ended.  It closing upon us even as water-lily upon its own tomorrow.  What was given us here we shall keep,  And if suffices not, then again must we come together together stretch our hands unto giver.  Forget that I shall come back to you.  A little while, my longing shall gather dust foam another body.  A little while, moment rest upon wind, another woman shall bear me.  Farewell youth I have spent you.  It was yesterday we met dream.  have sung me my aloneness, I your longings have built tower sky.  But now our sleep has fled our dream is over, longer dawn.  The noontide upon us our half waking has turned fuller day, we must part.  If twilight memory we should meet once more, we shall speak again together shall sing me deeper song.  And if our hands should meet another dream we shall build another tower in sky.  *****  So saying made signal seamen, straightway they weighed anchor cast ship loose its moorings, they moved eastward.  And cry people as single heart, rose into dusk was carried out over sea like great trumpeting.  Only Almitra was silent, gazing after  ship until had vanished into mist.  And when people dispersed she still stood alone upon sea-wall, remembering her heart saying,  “A little while, moment rest upon wind, another woman shall bear me.”  [Illustration: 0134]         End Gibran  *** END ***  ***** should be named 58585-0.txt 58585-0.zip ***** This associated files various formats will be found in:  http://www.gutenberg.org/5/8/5/8/58585/  Produced Archive   Updated editions will replace previous one--the old editions will be renamed.
